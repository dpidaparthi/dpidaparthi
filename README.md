# 👋 Hey there, I'm Dedeepya Pidaparthi!

🎓 I'm a rising sophomore at UMass Amherst, majoring in Computer Science and part of the Commonwealth Honors College. As a first-generation Indian immigrant and woman in tech, I'm passionate about using **technology for social good**. Especially in the realms of **artificial intelligence, machine learning, and web development**.

💡 I’m currently a Fellow at [Break Through Tech AI](https://breakthroughtech.org/) (2025–2026), a national program that helps college students from underrepresented backgrounds gain industry-relevant experience in machine learning. I’m also part of the **Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP)** at UMass, where I'm building foundational research skills in computing.

### ✨ Fun Facts About Me

- 📚✨ I’m a big reader — fantasy and romance novels are my comfort zone. If you ever want to talk about magical worlds or slow burns, I’m your person. 🪄🌸  
- 🌊🧳 I love to travel and explore new places. My most recent trip was to Newport, Rhode Island, and I’m still not over the ocean views. 🌅🐚  
- 🎧💗 Laufey and Conan Gray are my go-to artists when I need to romanticize life (or debug in peace). 🎀🎶
